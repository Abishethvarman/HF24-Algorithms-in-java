# Hacktoberfest 2024 - Java Algorithms Repository üéâ

Welcome to the **Java Algorithms Repository** for Hacktoberfest! This repository is designed to help developers, especially beginners, get comfortable with algorithms and open-source contributions. Whether you're here to enhance your coding skills or make your first pull request (PR), we welcome your contributions!

## üìå What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is an open-source event organized by **DigitalOcean** where participants submit at least **4 Pull Requests (PRs)** to GitHub repositories throughout October. Participants who successfully complete the challenge are eligible for awesome **swag, certificates**, and **recognition**.

## üóÇ Repository Overview

This repository focuses on **algorithm implementations in Java**. You are encouraged to contribute by adding new algorithms or optimizing existing ones. Our goal is to build a **comprehensive collection of algorithms** that can benefit everyone, from beginners to advanced learners.  

We cover algorithms in areas like:  
1. **Sorting algorithms** (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort)  
2. **Searching algorithms** (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)  
3. **Graph algorithms** (e.g., Dijkstra‚Äôs, BFS, DFS)  
4. **Dynamic programming** (e.g., Knapsack problem, Fibonacci sequence)  
5. **Recursion and Backtracking** (e.g., N-Queens, Maze Solver)  
6. **Mathematical algorithms** (e.g., GCD, Prime Number check)

## üõ† How to Contribute?

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Fork this repository**:  
   Click on the 'Fork' button in the top-right corner to create your copy of this repository.

2. **Clone the repository**:  
   Open your terminal and run the following commands:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hacktoberfest-java-algorithms.git
   cd hacktoberfest-java-algorithms
   ```

3. **Create a new branch**:  
   Use a meaningful branch name based on the algorithm you're working on.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-bubble-sort
   ```

4. **Implement your algorithm**:  
   Add your code in a new Java file under the appropriate folder (e.g., `sorting/`, `searching/`, etc.). Make sure your code is **properly commented** and **formatted**.

5. **Commit your changes**:  
   Write a descriptive commit message.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Bubble Sort algorithm"
   ```

6. **Push your code to GitHub**:  
   ```bash
   git push origin add-bubble-sort
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**:  
   Go to the repository on GitHub and click the 'Compare & pull request' button. Add a clear description of what your algorithm does and submit your PR.

8. **Respond to Review Feedback**:  
   A maintainer will review your PR. You may be asked to make some changes ‚Äì don‚Äôt worry! It‚Äôs all part of learning.

## üöÄ Guidelines for Code

1. **Language**: Use **Java** for all algorithm implementations.
2. **Folder Structure**: Place your code under appropriate folders, e.g., `sorting/QuickSort.java`.  
3. **File Naming**: Use **CamelCase** for file names (e.g., `BubbleSort.java`).  
4. **Comments**: Add comments to explain your code. Use Javadoc for method descriptions if possible.  
5. **Test Cases**: Include a simple `main()` method to demonstrate your algorithm with sample inputs and outputs.
